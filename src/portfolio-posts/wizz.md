This is an demonstration of simulating 3d on isometric 2d, mostly knowing as ***2.5d***<br>
Also the 2d coordinates are converted to isometric coordinates, as you can see on **top-left**.

On this demo i use HTML5 `Phaser` 

Use the top-right panel to customize the 3d object or the isometric floor.
