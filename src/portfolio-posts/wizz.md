Wizard of the shrine is my first `Phaser` game.<br>
It was made at December 2015.<br>

The challenge part was the art.<br>
Drawing and panting is not my thing.<br>
I had to study a lot to improve my illustration skills<br>
#### Art software used
- `Paint SAI tool` General illustration and sketching.
- `Photoshop` UI and sprite editions.
- `Flash` Sprite drawing and animations.

#### Programing
- `Phaser` Game engine.

#### General Developing Tools
- `GulpJS`
- [gulp.spritesmith](https://github.com/twolfson/gulp.spritesmith) for sprites textures
- Version control on `Git` and `Github`

Here a few 'timelapse' from the artwork :

<br>
The whole game development time-wise was 3 months.<br>
The majority of time was spent doing the assets.<br>
<br>


### Things that i learn from this project

- This was my first game from `Phaser`.<br>
It is a lot better than `Flash` and it are `open-source` which is huge.<br>
But `Phaser` still missing a few features that `Flash` have. 
- On `Phaser` you can create games for **mobile**, **PC**, **browsers** and even **consoles**.<br>
You can apply it for the mayor marketplaces like:  `Steam`, `Apple Store`, `Play Store`, `Amazon Store`.<br>

## The game

**Commands:**<br>
- Click to cast spell.
- Press `1` to cast laser beam.
- Press `2` to cast spell blast.
