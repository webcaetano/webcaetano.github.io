Multiplayer isometric plataform, with tilesets.<br>
Monsters movements are operated by a `nodejs` server.<br>
I had to make a map-editor for this plataform, you can <a href="http://webcaetano.github.io/portfolio-posts/Map+Editor/">see it here.</a><br>

This project was intent to be a MMORPG isometric, based on Ragnarok Online<br>
I'm still very pasionated about this project.<br>
But it could take years to launch the beta, if maked all alone<br>
And i can't support all that by myself 

I have switch this project to `Phaser` but its not live. 

Write on : 
- `NodeJS`
- `Socket.io`
- `Flash`
