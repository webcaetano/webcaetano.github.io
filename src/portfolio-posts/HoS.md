The development of this project was stopped at end of 2015.<br>
This was intent to be the a new version of my old Brazilian browser game **(BRGOL)**<br>
But international.<br>
The project was never finished.<br>
I have worked on browser games for 5 years.<br>
And i don't think i would ever make a browser game again.<br>
Only because the lack of marketplaces for that.
