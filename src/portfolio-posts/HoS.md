This is a project i was working at end of 2015.<br>
It was intent to be the a new version of my old Brazilian browser game **(BRGOL)**, but international.<br>

The back-end was write on `NodeJS`, with a few `Socket.io` for chat and events.<br>
The front-end in `AngularJS`. <br>
On development tools i used: `GulpJS`, `LessCSS` and `Handlebars`.<br>
Version control: `Git` and `Github`

For the avatar textures i used [gulp.spritesmith](https://github.com/twolfson/gulp.spritesmith)<br>
instead of `texturepacker` making it full automated and more customizable. 

The 'score plataform' art, was made on `Photoshop` and `3dsMax`.<br>
And the engine on `Phaser`<br>
