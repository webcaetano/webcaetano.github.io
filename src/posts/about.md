--> years old and I'm an Indie Game Developer <br>
Glad to have you spend a short time with me.

I'm an big enthusiastic about gaming developing, really enjoy and have fun in doing it.<br>

During 5 years i worked on my own browser-based game<br>
It's was an very successful Brazilian soccer game. With up 50k players registered.<br>

Currently I'm dedicating to freelancing and open-source projects.<br>
Most of all in `Phaser`.<br>
`Phaser` was a big watershed in my gaming career.<br>
I also have a vast knowledge in many languages (front and back-end),<br>
and good level at artwork and animation. 

Are you looking for a developer who cares about sprites,<br>
or a very passionated person about game making, in the US, Canada or UK? <i class="flag flag-us"></i> <i class="flag flag-ca"></i> <i class="flag flag-gb"></i><br /> 
I'm both, and if you've got an exciting gig, I'd love to know.
