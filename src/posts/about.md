Hi! I'm 26 years old and i'm an independent Game Developer :space_invader: <br>
Glad to have you spend a short time with me.

I'm an enthusiastic about gaming developing, really enjoy and have fun in doing it. <br>

During 2008 to 2013 i have been working in my own browser-based game as standalone. <br>
The game called **Brgol** *(google it, there's many images from fan-blogs)*. <br>
It's was an very successfull soccer brazilian game. :soccer:<br>
I have decide to stop it on 2013 to focus in internacional content.

Currently i'm dedicating to open-source projects and html5 games.<br>
I have vast knowlegde in many languages (front and back), and in create assets like animated sprites and GUI.

Are you looking for <b>a developer who cares about sprites</b> or 
<b>a designer who enjoy code</b> in the US, Canada or UK? <i class="flag flag-us"></i> <i class="flag flag-ca"></i> <i class="flag flag-gb"></i><br /> 
I'm both, and if you've got an exciting gig, I'd love to know.
