Hello, my name is Andre Caetano.<br>
<br>
I'm <!--esc 
	print(Math.floor( ((new Date()).getTime() - (new Date(1989, 8, 14)).getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25))) 
--> years old, I was born and raised in Brazil, and I'm a Game Developer.<br>
<br>
Game development is a passion for me. I immensely enjoy the challenges and take 
great pride in my work. Every now and then I have a little fun too! For five 
years, I worked on my own browser-based game called BRGOL. It's a turn-based 
game with RPG elements that pits Brazilian soccer teams head to head. Everyday, 
players would face-off in exhibition style matches on their way to the championship.<br>
With over 50 thousand players registered, it was a very successful game.
<br>
<br>
Currently, I work as a freelance game developer and the majority of my work is done in Phaser.<br>
I contribute to many open-source projects for the Phaser community as well as other languages<br>
such as NodeJS, gulp, PHP and MySQL to name a few.<br>It is my belief that any software can become more powerful and robust by being partly open source.<br>
In an open source project, contributions from community members are judged based on the merits of their work and new and innovative solutions become quickly adopted as they are proven to be better than what was previously used to build upon.  
<br>
In addition to game development, I am also proficient with many creative tools such as photoshop, after effects and adobe animate.<br>
Being capable of generating basic sprite animations. If you are looking for a developer who cares about sprites,<br>
and is very impassioned about game making, you've found him.I'm both, and if you've got an exciting gig,<br>
I'd love to hear about it.
